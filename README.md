# R-analysis-assignment
This is an assignment i have done in my course of R with statistics.
I was asked to come up with 3 questions from the data set provided using atleast 2-3 variables for each question.

**Understanding the data**

The data has been collected through landline telephonic interviews as well as cellular telephonic interviews. Their main objective is to collect uniform data that is state specific and they take into account behavioural risk factors of non-institutionalized adult population.It collects the data from all 50 states and terrotories.
As the interviews are conducted on a randomly selected member of a family this shows that they use stratified sampling so this means that they can only make assosications from the data collected and not imply causation as all the data that is collected is observational and not obtained from a study.


**Research quesion 1:**
Is there any association between hours of sleep and mental health?

**Research quesion 2:**
How many hours per week one works compared to income range and how it affects ones satisfaction from life?

**Research quesion 3:**
Is there any association between income group and height of a person?
